## Repo architecture
This repo is made up of the following crates:
- `dub-oxide`: A (currently unreleased) crate that aims to make splitting audio in pure Rust as easy as possible.
- `encoders/aiff`: A currently WIP crate for pure Rust AIFF encoding. Usable but a pretty naive and barebones implementation.
